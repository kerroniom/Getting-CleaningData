The steps associated with the analysis are as follows;

1) Downloaded the data (as per the 'README' fine, and saved into my working directory
2) Loaded the 6 files containing the test & training data into 6 data frames 
3) Joined the test & training data sets together using the 'rbind' command leaving 3 data frames
4) Loaded in the 'features' file, and gave it column headings which I will use later on when merging data frames
5) Joined the features info onto the corresponding data set, making sure only to include the fields with mean and standard deviation data
6) Loaded in the activity lables file, and again gave it column names which I will use when merging data frames later on
7) Merged the activity lables with the corresponding data set to replaced activity IDs 
8) Combined the remaining 3 data frames into one named 'TidyData1'
9) Wrote the 'TidyData1' into a file "merged_data.txt"

- I ran out of time so didnt complete any further aggregation of the data

The R script can be found in 'run_analysis.R', and will produce the above described results.
